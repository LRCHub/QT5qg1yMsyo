Do you remember the time,
I first held your hand,
Well that sure felt good enough to me
My wet grip was numb, my apology dumb
For pushin' when you say I got to wait.

You say I got to wait, don't tell me -
Don't tell me 'cuz I want to know
I got to know 'cuz it's my...

Do you remember the time I started groovin' you
I told you plans to marry you real soon.
We talked about stuff, we don't talk about much
And we don't have time for talkin' in between.
We'll buy matching rings and we'll flash 'em 'bout town
Our happiness will blind 'em with our teeth.
Do you remember the time I first held your hand,
'Cuz like that time don't tell me I got to wait.

You say I got to wait, don't tell me -
Don't tell me 'cuz I want to know
I got to know 'cuz it's my business
Let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
Busy with me.
It's my business, let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
Busy with me.

Alright now, huh, huh, huh...

Wait, you say I got to wait, don't tell me -
Don't tell me 'cuz I want to know
I got to know 'cuz it's my, it's my, it's my
It's my business, let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
Busy with me.
It's my business, let's get busy
It's my business, let's get busy
Busy with me.
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah, huh
Whoa
