Well, I might just consider this
If you don't let me down
If you can keep me happy
Well, you can stick around
Now, I don't care for sycophants
They drive me 'round the bend
But if you can't control yourself
Then let's just keep good friends

Let's make out in the back of your car
Let's go driving and tooling around
We could always get lost in a crowd
Are you ready to get deep down?

Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

Now there's something you should know about
I'm chronically depressed
I internalize my hatred and sacrifice myself
Now, I am busy Saturday
But I am free tonight
And I might have to sort you out
If you don't do it right

Let's make out in the back of your car
Let's go driving and tooling around
We could always get lost in a crowd
Are you ready to get deep down?

Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Get busy with the fizzy, baby

Let's make out in the back of your car
Let's go driving and tooling around
We could always get lost in a crowd
Are you ready to get deep down?

Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

Uh uh uh uh!
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Uh uh uh uh!
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Uh uh uh uh!
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Uh uh uh uh!
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Uh uh uh uh!
Get busy with the fizzy, baby
Uh uh uh uh!
